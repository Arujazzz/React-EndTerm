# TodoList
1. The application contains 2 pages: home and todo list
2. Transition between pages is implemented via navbar
3. On the main page there is a logo and a brief description of the page
4. On the todo list page there is an interactive list
5. Data for the list was requested from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
6. Implemented the ability to add/change/delete todo
7. Implemented pagination without page reload

## I use:
1. React
2. Redux
3. React router
4. Typescript
5. Axios
6. CSS libraries https://materializecss.com/
