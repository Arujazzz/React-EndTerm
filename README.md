# TodoList
The application contains 2 pages: home and todo list
Transition between pages is implemented via navbar
On the main page there is a logo and a brief description of the page
On the todo list page there is an interactive list
Data for the list was requested from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
Implemented the ability to add/change/delete todo
Implemented pagination without page reload
